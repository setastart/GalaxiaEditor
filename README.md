# Galaixa Editor


## list (pages blogs, etc)

    - indication for draft/special/published
    - picture
    - title in every language
        - main language bolder
    - slug in every language
    - date Modified



## database specification

- if an input ends with an underscore, like 'value_', galaxia will treat it as a multilingual field.
    - 'value_' becomes 'value_pt', 'value_en', according to your site language settings
    - underscores cannot be used as a string value, only as elements (to allow cloning)

- there must be a 'pages' table.
    - there must be 'status', 'title_', 'slug_' and 'pageType' columns.

- each table must have a primary key.
    - primary key cannot end with an underscore.

- Foreign keys across tables must have the same column name.

- Use unique names for columns to be joined

- select: first column of every table must be the primary key.
    - naming: pages -> pageId, events -> eventId, etc.
    - this key will be used to build the php array that contains the data.

- special column name prefixes:
    - timestamp

- special column names:
    - status
    - slug
    - slug_
    - title_
    - pageType
    - name
    - value
    - value_
    - position



## permissions

- the array with the key 'gcPerms' declares the necessary permissions in its values.

- on every page load, G::$conf is searched for any 'gcPerms' key.
    - when the key is found the users permissions are checked.
    - the parent of any element that doesn't have permissions is deleted.

- An autoloader with `Galaxia` and `GalaxiaEditor` namespaces used by GalaxiaEditor.
- An autoloader with just the `Galaxia` core helper classes to be used by your website code.
- Automatic High quality fast image resizing and great image compression using [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips)

### Design your database schema according to your website needs
- Be consistent using foreign keys.
- Be efficient and performant using indices best suited for your needs.
- Store each localised version of your content in its own database column.
- Be flexible with one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many column relationships.
- Schema convention to simplify your code.

### Minimal dependencies and complexity

    - there must be 'status', 'title_', 'slug_' and 'pageType' columns.

- each table must have a primary key.
    - primary key cannot end with an underscore.

- Foreign keys across tables must have the same column name.

- Use unique names for columns to be joined

- select: first column of every table must be the primary key.
    - naming: pages -> pageId, events -> eventId, etc.

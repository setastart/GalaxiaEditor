Fork from PHP Redis implementation V2.1
==============

- Same code, but as a composer library.
- Rename class from `redis_cli` to `RedisCli`
- Make tests work with PHPUnit 8.


## Original README:

Yet another php redis implementation.
Raw wrapper for real [Redis] fans. Main advantages:

* Doesn't require any dependencies as all the communication goes via tcp socket.
* All commands are passed as is, so you have all the freedom to play with redis just like in redis-cli.
* It won't get deprecated or obsolete for the same reason. You write raw commands by yourself.
* Doesn't matter which redis version you have.
* Supports chainable methods. Write multiple commands and send everything at once.
* Custom error function to handle errors.
* Dead Simple and lightweight, you're welcome to read all the 300+ lines of redis.php
* Forces you to actually learn and understand redis data structures and commands.

## Download
You can checkout latest version with:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ziogas/PHP-Redis-implementation


## Install
To install PHP redis:

* Simply copy redis.php to your site and require it from external script

Here are some examples:

```php
require 'redis.php';

function redis_error($error) {
    throw new error($error);
}

$redis = new redis_cli ();
$redis->set_error_function('redis_error');

$redis->cmd('SET', 'foo', 'bar')
      ->cmd('HSET', 'hash', 'field', 'val')
      ->cmd('EXPIRE', 'foo', 300)
      ->set();

$foo = $redis->cmd('GET', 'foo')->get();
$field = $redis->cmd('HGET', 'hash', 'field')->get();

var_dump($foo);
var_dump($field);
```

More usage examples can be found on tests folder.
For commands documentation just go directly to [https://redis.io/commands]

## Running tests
